# Project Overview

The Ball Mill Monitoring System is a modern, extensible web application for real-time and historical monitoring of ball mill operations across multiple industrial locations. It integrates live video, sensor data acquisition, real-time and historical data visualization, and supports extensibility for new sensor types and locations.

**Key Goals:**
- Centralize monitoring of multiple ball mills and pipelines.
- Provide real-time and historical sensor data visualization.
- Integrate live video streams for each monitored location.
- Enable rapid extension for new sensors, locations, and analysis features.

**Primary Users:**
- Plant operators and engineers
- Data analysts
- System integrators

**Key Features:**
- Real-time sensor data acquisition and visualization
- Live YouTube video stream embedding per location
- Historical data analysis and interactive plots
- Modular, reusable UI components
- Python integration for sensor/PLC data acquisition and simulation
- Extensible database schema for new sensors/locations
